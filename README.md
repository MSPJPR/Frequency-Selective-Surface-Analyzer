Objective:

This project is an interactive web-based Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) Analyzer that allows users to:

1. Analyze FSS for different substrate materials and frequencies.


2. Visualize 3D models of different FSS geometries.


3. Generate and display reflection coefficient graphs.


4. Download an analysis report.

Features:

1. FSS Analysis:

Users input frequency (GHz) and select a substrate material.

The system processes the input and displays an analysis result.



2. 3D Model Visualization:

Users can choose different geometrical structures like Cube, Sphere, Cylinder, and Torus Knot.

Models are rendered using Three.js with real-time rotation effects.



3. Reflection Coefficient Graph:

Graphs are plotted using D3.js to visualize the variation of reflection coefficients with frequency.

The system dynamically updates and displays the graph.



4. Download Report:

Users can download the FSS analysis report as a .txt file.

3D Visualization: Three.js

Graph Plotting: D3.js

Conclusion:

This project provides an intuitive interface for analyzing Frequency Selective Surfaces. It combines theoretical calculations, interactive 3D models, and real-time data visualization, making it an ideal tool for students and researchers. ðŸš€
